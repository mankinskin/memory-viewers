# ticket-viewer: explorer interactions

Canonical specification for the ticket-viewer navigation surfaces that let a user find and open tickets: the sidebar explorer and the quick-search overlay.

## Sidebar explorer

The sidebar explorer combines:

- a free-text query input
- state filter chips
- a sorted ticket list / tree surface
- optional expanded file rows under a ticket

### Filtering contract

1. Query text and state filters combine with AND semantics.
2. Multiple selected states combine with OR semantics.
3. The empty state-filter set means "All states".
4. Explorer persistence includes query text, selected states, sort key, and selected ticket.
5. Free-text terms search ticket titles and description/body content, including partial-word substring matches such as `cracker` -> `Firecracker`.
6. Within a query string, whitespace-separated terms combine with AND semantics, and quoted phrases remain a single term.
7. Supported explicit predicates are `id:<value>`, `title:<value>`, `state:<value>` / `status:<value>`, and `type:<value>` / `ticket_type:<value>`.
8. `title:<value>` searches title content only and still supports substring matches for single terms such as `title:cracker` -> `Firecracker`.
9. The sidebar and quick-search hint copy must advertise only the supported predicate keys and the title/body free-text scope.

### Transport contract

The explorer issues `GET /api/tickets` requests with:

- `workspace=<name>`
- optional `query=<text>`
- zero or more repeated `state=<value>` parameters
- optional `limit=<n>`

Repeated `state` parameters are the canonical multi-state format. A single `state` parameter remains valid as the one-state case.

## Keyboard behavior

### Sidebar explorer

When the sidebar tree itself owns focus:

- `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` move between visible ticket rows.
- Phase 1 ticket navigation applies to ticket rows, not expanded file child rows.
- `Enter` opens the focused ticket.
- Text inputs in the explorer own their own keystrokes and suppress row-navigation shortcuts while focused.

### Quick-search overlay

When quick-search is open:

- `ArrowDown` / `ArrowUp` move a highlighted result index through the visible result set.
- `Enter` opens the highlighted result.
- `Escape` closes the overlay.
- Typing in the search box keeps focus in the input and does not trigger background viewer shortcuts.

## Acceptance behavior

- The sidebar can show tickets from multiple workflow states at the same time.
- A query combined with selected states only returns tickets that match the query and at least one selected state.
- A unique phrase that appears only in a ticket description/body is discoverable from the sidebar query and the quick-search overlay.
- A partial-word substring query such as `cracker` surfaces tickets containing `Firecracker` in the title or description/body.
- A `title:` predicate such as `title:cracker` surfaces tickets containing `Firecracker` in the title without relying on description/body matches.
- The quick-search overlay must not silently truncate broad backend matches to eight rows; when a query returns more than eight hits, the overlay still surfaces at least the first nine ranked matches and allows scrolling through the list.
- The sidebar and quick-search both expose deterministic visible keyboard focus.
- The visible search hints document the supported predicate keys, quoted-phrase behavior, and conjunction semantics without mentioning unsupported fields.
- Opening a different ticket from the sidebar updates the content-panel body and URL hash for the newly selected ticket; previously rendered description content must not remain visible after the selection changes.
- Reloading the page restores the persisted explorer filter state without corrupting older saved state.
- If `/api/tickets` or `/api/stream` fails, the sidebar keeps rendering its error or empty-state copy without panicking the WASM app.
- After those offline failures, clicking or reconnect retries must not crash the explorer; the route stays interactive and can recover when the backend returns.

	- `npm run test:e2e:release -- keyboard-navigation.spec.ts -g "sidebar filter keeps focus|documents supported syntax"`
	- `npm run test:e2e:release -- keyboard-navigation.spec.ts -g "documents supported syntax|surfaces at least nine results"`
	- `npm run test:e2e:release -- keyboard-navigation.spec.ts -g "matches partial-word substrings|documents supported syntax|surfaces at least nine results"`
	- `viewer-ctl prepare ticket-viewer && cargo build -p ticket-viewer --release && cd memory-viewers/ticket-viewer/frontend/dioxus && npm run test:e2e:release -- mixed-workspace-root-route.spec.ts -g "swaps content panel body when clicking different ticket rows"`
	- Headed Edge visual verification at `1440x900` against the managed `ticket-viewer`: clicked two sidebar ticket rows and confirmed the content panel rendered different description bodies for each selection.
- Viewer validation blocked by an existing unrelated failure in `npm run test:e2e:release -- keyboard-navigation.spec.ts`: `quick-search keeps input focus while arrows move the active result and Enter opens it` still fails because the selected sidebar ticket is not found after opening a search result.
